# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose

This project focus on creating a webpage that accesses data from several different sources and diplays it clearly on a map. In this project we accessed data from an Mapbox API and a GeoJSON. The API gives access to the basemaps, and the GeoJSON provides the earthquake data.

## Results
The webpage opens up with a street view of the world. There's a filter option on the upper right hand corner of the page which give the user to change the view of the map to - street/Satellite/Dark mode view. Also the filter provides add/remove view of Earthquakes/Tectonic/Major Earthquake data.
